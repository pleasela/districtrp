# esx_diving

Contributor: **@Nelyo#1462** and **@SUP2Ak#2222**

# How to:
 - Import the SQL file for create both item and add them to shop
 - Put esx_diving in [esx] folder
 - Add: start esx_diving on server.cfg
 - Enjoy

After that, you need to buy one on this item on a shop, go near water and just use.
Once you have finish diving, you will need to go to a clotheshop to change you clothes.
I will update the script later to change automatically clothe after finish diving. 

# What next?
Fill free to update the script but don't forget to share or update this repository also.

Have Fun!
